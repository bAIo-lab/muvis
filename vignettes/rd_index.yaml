## layout the order in which topics are presented in the rd docs
# 1. get a list of topics with the following:
#    db <- tools::Rd_db("muvis")
#    topics <- gsub("\\.Rd", "", names(db))
#    cat(paste(topics, collapse = "\n"))
# 2. arrange the topic names into sections as desired in the format below:
## If you need to see which topics are missing, do the following in addition:
# cur <- yaml::yaml.load_file("rd_index.yaml")
# cur <- unlist(lapply(cur, function(x) x$topics))
# cat(paste(setdiff(topics, cur), collapse = "\n"))
